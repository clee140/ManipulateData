named PovertyData.txt, found in the downloads folder contains the raw data that will be input into the program.
The raw data from the file is read and the total population, child population, child poverty population by each state
code will be summarized. The summarized data will be formatted and printed in a new text file named
UpdatedPovertyData.txt.
